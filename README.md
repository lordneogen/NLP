##  Overview

This NLP (Natural Language Processing) project aims to enhance Llama 3 models' inference speed using Unsloth, an AI model designed for faster computation. It provides step-by-step instructions on setting up environments, loading libraries, downloading datasets, configuring training parameters, and evaluating the performance of trained models. The ultimate goal is to optimize Llama 3 models with Unsloth's optimization techniques.

				<td>- The provided code file is a Jupyter notebook named "Llama_3_1_8b_+_Unsloth_2x_faster_finetuning.ipynb"<br>- This notebook is designed to run on Google Colab, a free cloud-based service for machine learning and data science<br>- The purpose of this code is to fine-tune Llama 3 model with Unsloth, which is an AI model specifically designed for faster inference speed.

The notebook provides instructions on how to set up the environment, load necessary libraries, download datasets, configure training parameters, train models, and evaluate their performance<br>- The ultimate goal of this code is to improve the inference speed of Llama 3 models using Unsloth's optimization techniques.</td>

				<td><b><a href='https://github.com/lordneogen/NLP/blob/master/jsonl_to_csv.py'>jsonl_to_csv.py</a></b></td>
				<td>- The file 'jsonl_to_csv.py' is a Python script that converts a JSONL (JSON lines) file into CSV format<br>- It reads each line from the JSONL file, transforms it into a dictionary object using json.loads(), and then writes this dictionary to a CSV file with specified fieldnames<br>- This process allows for easy data manipulation and analysis in spreadsheet software or other data processing tools.</td>
